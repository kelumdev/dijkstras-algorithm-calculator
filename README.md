## Features

* Calculate the shortest path between any two nodes in a Graph.
* Display the traversed path and its total distance.

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 18.00 or later) and npm (version 5.6 or later) installed on your system. You can verify these by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Open your terminal and navigate to the desired directory using `cd`. Then, clone this repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kelumdev/shortest-path-calculator
3. **Install Dependencies:** `npm install`
4. **Run the Project:** `npm run dev`

## Tests
- in a different terminal, `npm run test` runs all the tests
